# Design Token Studio - MVP

Visual editor for design system tokens. Edit colors, see live preview, export JSON.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Open in browser
open index.html
```

## Features (MVP)

✅ Visual color pickers (4 tokens: primary, secondary, background, text)  
✅ Live preview - see changes instantly  
✅ Export to JSON  
✅ Copy to clipboard  
✅ Zero dependencies - pure HTML/CSS/JS

## What It Does

1. **Edit Tokens** - Use color pickers to adjust design tokens
2. **Live Preview** - See changes applied to UI components in real-time
3. **Export** - Copy JSON output for use in your codebase

## Next Steps

- [ ] More token types (typography, spacing, shadows)
- [ ] Multiple export formats (CSS vars, Tailwind, SCSS)
- [ ] Accessibility checker (WCAG contrast)
- [ ] Pre-built templates (Material, Tailwind, shadcn)
- [ ] React/Next.js version for advanced features

**Philosophy:** Prove the core loop works (edit → preview → export) before adding complexity.
